Project 1 for NMED 3850B at the University of Lethbridge

This project was a critique of loot crates in the gaming sphere. 
The user is encouraged to click on the button for new crates in an effort to get the ultimate reward. However the ultimate reward was never added to the loot table. 
I wanted to see how long people would click on the crates in an effort to get the reward they wanted.
