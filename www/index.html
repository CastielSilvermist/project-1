                <p> This app was designed to mimic the Loot Crates in Elder Scrolls Online. Functionality is overly simple. Click on the card and get your 'reward'. When the 'reward' vanishes you have the chance to try again. </p>
                <p>Loot crates are a controversial topic for many, and many of us question where we should draw the line when it comes to these crates. In essence its a form of gambling. We are taking a chance to get the item we desperately want, and often common sense takes a leave of absense. The number of times you clicked on the cards trying to get the 'rare' Blood Senche and her cub just goes to show this point. If you clicked more than ten times, its more than likely you wanted to take the chance and see if you'd get it.</p>
                <p>Sometimes taking a 'chance' is worth it...but in this case, was it really?</p>
